Access modifiers can determine security levels because they can control who can access whatever comes after, such as class, attributes, constructors, or methods.

There are 4 types of access levels.

public

protected

no modifier

private

But since I am a beginner, let's just focus on public, private and no modifier.

Here is a chart that shows the different access levels for different modifiers.

|modifier|From within the same class|From within the same package|From a class in a different package|
|---|---|---|---|
|public|Y|Y|Y|
|no modifier|Y|Y|N|
|private|Y|N|N|

The chart above shows different security levels.

# Let's consider the following examples of different accessibilities for class variable.

## From within the same class

#### public

```java
public class Human {
    public static int age = 30;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(age);        // 30
    }
}
```

#### no modifier

```java
public class Human {
    static int age = 30;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(age);        // 30
    }
}
```

#### private

```java
public class Human {
    private static int age = 30;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(age);        // 30
    }
}
```

## From within the same package

Let's assume that Human.java and Main.java are in the same package.

#### public

Human.java

```java
public class Human {
    public static int age = 30;
}
```

Main.java

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Human.age);      // 30
    }
}
```

---

#### no modifier

Human.java

```java
public class Human {
    static int age = 30;
}
```

Main.java

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Human.age);      // 30
    }
}
```

---

#### private

Human.java

```java
public class Human {
    private static int age = 30;
}
```

Main.java

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Human.age);      // error
    }
}
```

```
error: age has private access in Human
        System.out.println(Human.age);
                                ^
1 error
```

With private modifier, accessing the class variable within the same packagage will throw an error.

## From a class in a different package

Let's suppose that we have Creature class, and Human class in different packages.

#### public

package1/Creature.java

```java
public class Creature {
    public static int lifespan = 50;
}
```

package2/Human.java

```java
import package1.Creature;

public class Human {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Creature.lifespan);      // 50
    }
}
```

#### no modifier

package1/Creature.java

```java
public class Creature {
    static int lifespan = 50;
}
```

package2/Human.java

```java
import package1.Creature;

public class Human {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Creature.lifespan);      // throw an error
    }
}
```

#### private

package1/Creature.java

```java
public class Creature {
    private static int lifespan = 50;
}
```

package2/Human.java

```java
import package1.Creature;

public class Human {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Creature.lifespan);      // throw an error
    }
}
```

# The conclusion

Depending on the modifier and location, whatever comes after the modifier, <i>such as class, class variable(attribute) or instance variable(attribute), static method, or instance method</i>, have different accessibility.

In other words,

The accessibility of a class, attribute(either class level or instance level), or method(either class level or instance level) depends on the modifier(public, no modifier/default, private) we use.

# One thing to keep in mind,

Let's say that there is a private class attribute(variable), this class variable isn't accessed by anywhere other than from within the same class it was declared. We learned this already.

However, even if a class variable is private, it can be accessed through the public getter method.

And this is a common way to handle private class attribute(variable).

Consider the following example.

Apartment.java

```java
public class Apartment {
    private int suites = 6;

    public static void getSuites() {
        System.out.println(suites);
    }
}
```

Condo.java

```java
public class Condo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Apartment.getSuites();  // 6, even if Apartment.suites is private, it can still be accessed through public getSuites() method.
    }
}
```
