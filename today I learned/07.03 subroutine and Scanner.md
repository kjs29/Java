# Subroutine

Let's consider the following example.

```java
public class Hello {
    public static printHelloWorld() {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printHelloWorld();
    }
}
```

`printHelloWorld` is a subroutine. 

###### Subroutine is a method.

# blackbox

In java,

A subroutine is often said to be 'blackbox', because we can't see what is inside it.

More like we don't want to see what is inside because we don't want to deal with the complexity that the subroutine is meant to hide.

Rules of black box(subroutine or method):

1. Interface of the blackbox should be straight forward.

2. People who use the blackbox shouldn't need to know anything about the implementation.

3. Implementator shouldn't need to know where and how the blackbox will be used.

# Subroutine should be semantically correct as well as syntactically correct.

# Every subroutine must be defined inside some class

```

Subroutines are grouped in classes, and classes are grouped into packages.


# Definition

```java
public static void printHelloWorld() {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```


Subroutine's form

```
<modifiers> <return-type> <subroutine-name> (<parameter-list>) {
    <statements>
}
```

### `modifiers` sets certain characteristics of subroutines.

Examples: `public`, `static`

There are only about 12 modifiers.

### `return-type` can be `Int`, `String`, or `double[]`

`return-type` determines what kind of data type the return value is.

### `<parameter-list>`

`<type> <parameter name>`

Example: 

```java
public static void changeChannel(int channel) {

}
```

`channel` is the parameter name, and it is an `int` type.

# Scanner

We can use Scanner class in java.util package to catch user's input.

Let's consider this example. I will use mixture of subroutine and Scanner.

Rectangle.java

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Rectangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int width;
        int height;
        
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Type width : ");
        width = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Type height : ");
        height = scanner.nextInt();

        int area = rectangleArea(width, height);
        int perimeter = rectanglePerimeter(width, height);
        System.out.printf("Rectanlge area is %d / Rectangle perimeter is %d", area, perimeter);
        System.out.println();
    }
    
    public static int rectangleArea(int w, int h) {
        return w * h;
    }

    public static int rectanglePerimeter(int w, int h) {
        return 2 * (w + h);
    }
}
```


Result:

```
Type width : 
200
Type height : 
5
Rectanlge area is 1000 / Rectangle perimeter is 410
```
