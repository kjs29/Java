We have a class `Person`

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(){
        this.name = "unknown name";
        age = 0;
    }

    public Person(String name, int age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

We created two constuctors, 

if the constructor is instantiated without any arguments, their name and age will be automatically

"unknown name" and 0 respectively, if the arguments were provided, the arguments will be their names and ages.

We can access name and age through getters and setters.

We can write `Student` class that inherits from `Person` class.

<em>Student.java</em>

```java
public class Student extends Person {
    private int studentId;

    public Student() {
        super();
    }

    public Student(String name, int age, int studentId) {
        super(name, age);
        this.studentId = studentId;
    }

    public int getStudentId() {
        return this.studentId;
    }

    public void setStudentId(int studentId) {
        this.studentId = studentId;
    }
}
```

In `Student`,

```java
public class Student extends Person {}
```

This will inherit the class `Person`,

it has two constructors, 

one for no arguments, and the other with arguments.

When it creates a contstructor, the `super()` should come as the first statement.

This `super()` calls the `Person` class's constructor `Person()`.

```java
public Person(){
    this.name = "unknown name";
    age = 0;
}
```
And we created another constructor in `Student` class.

```java
super(name, age);
```

calls the `Person` class's constructor `Person(String name, int age)`.

```java
public Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
```

Let's see if they work successfully

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Student s1 = new Student();
        Student s2 = new Student("Rock", 33, 211224);

        System.out.println(s1.getName()+ " is " + s1.getAge()+" years old.");
        System.out.println(s2.getName()+ " is " + s2.getAge()+" years old.");
        System.out.println(s2.getStudentId());
    }
}
```

Result:

```
unknown name is 0 years old.
Rock is 33 years old.
211224
```
