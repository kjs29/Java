# What is a networking?

Networking is connecting two or even more computing devices to share resources. (Simplilearn, 2022)

In a client-server model, for two or more different devices to communicate, a server is set up to listen for incoming connections. 

The server utilizes a Server Socket to wait for client requests. 

When a client sends a request to the server through Socket, the Server Socket on the server accepts the request, and a new Socket instance is created. 

This Socket instance on the server and the Socket on the client can now be used to facilitate communication between the server and the client. 

Through these sockets, data can be sent and received, enabling the server and client to interact with each other.

# Socket

The purpose of a Socket is to send/receive data between computers. 

Socket serves as and endpoint for receiving and sending data within a computer network.

# Server socket

Server socket accepts the request and usually establishes communication between client and server and creates Sockets.
