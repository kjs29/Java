My first java program

```java
package practice;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Trial {
    
    public static boolean findMe(String[] arr, String item) {
        for (String eachItem : arr) {
            if (eachItem == item) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String[] cars = new String[] {"tesla", "bmw", "jaguar", "hyundai", "kia"};

        Boolean isHelloInCars = Trial.findMe(cars, "hello");

        System.out.println(isHelloInCars);
    }
}

```

My file structure looks like the below.

```
Java
│
└───practice
    │
    ├───Trial.java
    ├───AnotherClass.java
    │
    └───UoPeople
        │
        ├───Student.java
        └───Course.java

```

Package groups related classes and interfaces together. It helps with organizing and naming conflicts.

The `package practice;` statement declares that the class in the java file is in the package called `practice`.

As we can see in the file structure, the `Trial.java` is in practice directory. The package name is usually the same as directory name.

When I compile my java file `javac practice/Trial.java` at `Java/` location,

it creates the byte code file `Trial.class` in the `Java/practice` location.

So the file structures now looks like this.

```
Java
│
└───practice
    │
    ├───Trial.java
    ├───Trial.class
    │
    ├───AnotherClass.java
    │
    └───UoPeople
        │
        ├───Student.java
        └───Course.java
```

In the file, 

I created a public static boolean method `findMe` that takes two arguments, `String[] arr` and `String item`.

`findMe` iterates through the `arr`, and returns true once any element in the `arr` matches the `item`.

And then I call `findMe` method, with arguments `cars` and `hello`.

Since `findMe` is a static method, we can use dot notation to access and call it on the class `Trial`
