## Probability Distribution Function (PDF)

1. Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive.

2. The sum of the probabilities is one.

`expected value` is often referred to as the long term average or mean.

𝜇(expected value of discrete probability function) = $\sum (x * P(x))$

𝜎(standard deviation) = $\sqrt{\sum[(x-\mu)^{2}*P(x)]}$

## Example question.

```
Find the expected value of the number of times a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. 

The expected value is the expected number of times per week a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. 

Calculate the standard deviation of the variable as well.
```

|x|P(x)|x*P(x)|(x – μ)2 ⋅ P(x)|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|2/50|0|(0 – 2.1)2 ⋅ 0.04 = 0.1764|
|1|11/50|11/50|(1 – 2.1)2 ⋅ 0.22 = 0.2662|
|2|23/50|46/50|(2 – 2.1)2 ⋅ 0.46 = 0.0046|
|3|9/50|27/50|(3 – 2.1)2 ⋅ 0.18 = 0.1458|
|4|4/50|16/50|(4 – 2.1)2 ⋅ 0.08 = 0.2888|
|5|1/50|5/50|(5 – 2.1)2 ⋅ 0.02 = 0.1682|

variance = 0.1764 + 0.2662 + 0.0046 + 0.1458 + 0.2888 + 0.1682 = 1.05

standard deviation = $\sqrt{1.05}$ $\approx$ 1.0247

In java

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Statistics {
    static void findStdev(int[] x, double[] pX) {
            
        ArrayList<Double> xPx = new ArrayList<Double>();
        
        for (int i=0;i<x.length;i++) {
            xPx.add(x[i]*pX[i]);
        }

        System.out.println(xPx);

        double mean = 0;
        for (double num : xPx) {
            mean += num;
        }

        System.out.printf("mean (expected value) : %.6f\n", mean);

        double variance = 0;
        
        for (int i=0;i<x.length;i++) {
            int xEl = x[i];
            double pXEl = pX[i];
            variance += ((Math.pow((xEl - mean), 2) * pXEl));
        }

        System.out.printf("variance : %.6f\n", variance);
        System.out.printf("standard deviation : %.6f\n", Math.sqrt(variance));
        System.out.printf("-----------------------------------------\n");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] x1 = {0,1,2,3,4,5};
        double[] px1 = {2.0/50, 11.0/50, 23.0/50, 9.0/50, 4.0/50, 1.0/50};

        findStdev(x1, px1);
    }
}

```

The result:

```
[0.0, 0.22, 0.92, 0.54, 0.32, 0.1]
mean (expected value) : 2.100000
variance : 1.050000
standard deviation : 1.024695
-----------------------------------------
```

## Binomial Distribution

1. There are fixed number of trials.

2. Two possible outcomes “Success” or “Failure”

3. Each trial is independent and repeated under the same conditions.

n: number of trials

p: probability of success in a single trial

q: probability of failure in a single trial (q=1-p)

x: The random variable represents a count of the number of successes in n trials: x=0,1,2,3,…,n

𝜇(mean): 𝜇 = np

σ(standard deviation): σ=$\sqrt{npq}$

Then I can try making program like below.

```java
package statistics;

public class Probability {
    
    static long factorial(int n) {
        long result = 1;

        for (int i=2;i<=n;i++) {
            result *= i;
        }

        return result;
    }

    static long choose(int n, int r) {
        long answer = (factorial(n)/(factorial(r)*factorial(n-r)));
        return answer;
    }

    static double binomialProbability(int n, int k, double p, boolean isCdf) {
        if (!isCdf) {
            double answer = choose(n, k) * Math.pow(p,k) * Math.pow((1 - p),(n - k));
            return answer;		
        }
        
        // if isCdf is true and k is 12, 
        // return P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + ... + P(X=12)
        double result = 0;
        for (int ki=0;ki<=k;ki++) {
            result += (choose(n, ki) * Math.pow(p,ki) * Math.pow((1 - p),(n - ki)));
        }
        return result; 
    }
}
```

## Example question.

```
It has been stated that about 41% of adult workers have a high school diploma 

but do not pursue any further education. 

If 20 adult workers are randomly selected, 

find the probability that at most 12 of them have a high school diploma?
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(binomialProbability(20, 12, 0.41, true));
}
```

The answer is `0.9738`

## Example question.

```
In the same factory scenario mentioned before, 

where the quality control system finds that 99% of the products manufactured meet the quality standards, 

if a sample of 5 products is randomly selected, 

what is the probability that exactly 4 of them meet the quality standards?
```


```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(binomialProbability(5, 4, 0.99, false));
}
```
