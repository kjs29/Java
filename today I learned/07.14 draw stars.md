Sometimes we encounter questions like below.

Draw stars that looks like this.

```
  *    
 ***   
***** 
```

What is this question asking?

Well, we need to first see how many iterations there are.

We can intuitively see 3 iterations, since there are 3 rows. We can see that using a for loop can be a possbility.

```java
public class Stars {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // 3 iterations
        for (int i=1;i<=3;i++) {
            
        }
    }
}
```

Now, this for loop will iterate 3 times, each time it iterates, i's value changes from 1 to 2 to 3.

(The reason why i does not start with 0, is because when i starts with 1, it will be easier to define relationships between i and whitespaces/stars, but it doesn't really matter. What really matter is if we think of creating a loop that iterates three times.)

# 3 Key observations

1. Now, we know that in the 1st iteration, it is made up of 2 whitespaces + 1 star + 2 whitespaces.


```
" " + " " + "*" + " " + " "
```

2. We know that in the 2nd iteration, it is made up of 1 white space + 3 stars + 1 whitespace.

```
" " + "***" + " "
```

3. Finally in the 3rd iteration, it is made up of 5 stars.

```
"*****"
```

i = iteration

w = number of whitespace

s = number of stars

We have to establish relationships between

1. i and w

2. i and s

Let's create a chart that visualizes this.

|**iteration**|whitespace|stars|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|2|1|
|**2**|1|3|
|**3**|0|5|

# Relationship between iteration and whitespace

We can solve relationship between i and w using this linear equation.

$ax + b = y$

|**iteration(x)**|whitespace(y)|
|---|---|
|**1**|2|
|**2**|1|
|**3**|0|


$a + 2c = 2$

$2a + c = 1$

So a is -1, b is 3.

Then we can create a equation that describes the relationsip between iteration and whitespace. 

```
whitespace = -iteration + 3
```

In python, we can write like the example below.

```py
for i in range(1, 4):
    # print whitespace
    print((-i+3)*" ", end="")   # multiplication operator works with string
```

But in java, we can't write the way we write in Python because we can't use multiplication operator with String.

```java
System.out.print(" " * (3-i)); // multiplication operator does not work with string in Java
```

There are two different ways to implement this.

```java
for (int i=0;i<3;i++) {
    System.out.print(" ".repeat(3-i));
}
```

or 

```java
for (int i=0;i<3;i++) {
    for (int j=1;j<=3-i;j++) {
        System.out.print(" ");
    }
}
```

# Relationship between iteration and stars

Just like how we used linear equation to get a relationship between iteration and whitespace previously, we can also define a relationship between iteration and stars.

$ax + b = y$

Let iteration be x, and stars be y.

|**iteration**|stars|
|---|---|
|**1**|1|
|**2**|3|
|**3**|5|

$a + b = 1$

$2a + b = 3$

a is 2, and b = -1

So the relationship between iteration and stars is 

```
2 * iteration - 1 = stars
```

To implement this relationship to codes, we can use two different methods.

First method.

```java
// using repeat()
for (int i=1;i<3;i++) {
    int star = 2 * i - 1;
    System.out.print("*".repeat(star));
}
```

Second method.

```java
// nested for loop
for (int i=1;i<3;i++) {
    for (int j=1;j<2*i-1;j++) {
        System.out.print("*");
    }
}
```

The meaning of first and second method are a little different. 

The first method means the fixed integer star will be determined by i.

The second method means there will be (2 * i - 1) number of iterations in each outer loop. (when i=1, there will be 1 iteration, when i=2, there will be 3 iterations.)

Putting all these together looks like this in Java.

```java
public class Stars {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        for (int i=1;i<=3;i++) {
            int whitespaces = 3 - i;
            int stars = 2 * i - 1;

            System.out.print(" ".repeat(whitespaces));
            System.out.print("*".repeat(stars));
            System.out.print(" ".repeat(whitespaces));

            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

Let's modify the code by separating the method, and method calling.

```java
public class Stars {
    private static void drawStars(int height) {
        for (int i=1;i<=height;i++) {
            int whitespaces = height - i;
            int stars = 2 * i - 1;

            System.out.print(" ".repeat(whitespaces));
            System.out.print("*".repeat(stars));
            System.out.print(" ".repeat(whitespaces));

            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        drawStars(10);
    }
}
```

Result:

```
         *         
        ***        
       *****       
      *******      
     *********     
    ***********    
   *************   
  ***************
