# To be able to use JavaFX in VScode

1. Download the JavaFX SDK from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

2. Create a `sdks` folder in the root directory. Assuming that the folder is downloaded to `~/Downloads/`, copy the whole file to the new `sdks` folder.

```
cd ~
mkdir ~/sdks
mv ~/Downloads/javafx-sdk-20 ~/sdks/
```

3. Since I use zshell, this is what `.zprofile` looks like. (Setting up environment variable)

```shell
# Setting PATH_TO_FX for JavaFX
export PATH_TO_FX=/Users/jinsung/sdks/javafx-sdk-20.0.2/lib
```

VS Code setting

Create lib folder under the root directory of the project I am working on.

In my case, my root directory is called `Java`.

Under the root directory `Java`, create a folder called `lib`

And I pasted the files in the lib folder from SDK folder I downloaded from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

The downloaded package also has `lib` folder, and copy the `*.jar` files and paste them into the `lib` folder we just created.

<em>keybindings.json</em>

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+'",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
    "args": { 
        "text": "javac --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls ${fileBasename} && java --module-path /Users/jinsung/sdks/javafx-sdk-20.0.2/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml ${fileBasenameNoExtension}\u000D" 
    },
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'java'"
},
```
